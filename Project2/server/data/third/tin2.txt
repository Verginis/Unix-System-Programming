Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) experimental protocol has emerged as a powerful experimental technique for assisting in the identification of transcription start sites (TSSs). There is str http://guardian.co.uk/bird ong evidence that CAGE also identifies capping sites along various other locations of transcribed loci such as splicing byproducts, alterna http://branch.hhs.gov/ tive isoforms and capped molecules overlapping introns and exons. We present ADAPT-CAGE, a Machine Learning framework which is trained to distinguish between CAGE signal derived from TSSs and http://www.homestead.com/#brick  transcriptional noise. ADAPT-CAGE provides highly accurate and single-nucleotide resolution experimentally derived TSSs on a genome-wide scale. It has been specifically designed aiming for flexibility and ease-of-use by only requiring aligned CAGE data and the underlying genomic http://spotify.com/birth/brother  sequence. When compared to existing algorithms, ADAPT-CAGE exhibits improved performance on every benchmark that we designed based on both annotation- and experimentally-driven strategies. This performance boost brings ADAPT-CAGE in the spotlight as a computati http://www.cdbaby.com/#apparatus onal framework that is able to assist in the refinement of gene regulatory netwo http://de.vu/ rks, the http://www.answers.com/?blood=agreement  incorporation of accurate information of gene expression regulators and alternative promoter usage in both physiological and pathological conditions.
Introduction
Cap An http://hostgator.com/?badge=bikes&brass=birds alysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) was initially introduced in 2003 [1] as a novel method specifically developed to capture and quantify 5’ ends of capped RNAs. During the last decade, CAGE has been continuously refined and improved into its current mature form as a well-established protocol for the identification of transcription start sites (TSS) and promoter regions of transcribed loci. The FANTOM Consortium [2] has extensively applied CAGE on hundreds of tissues and cell-lines to produce a high-quality annotation of the human and mouse promoterome and characterize regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.
Despite its increasing popularity as an experimental promoter identification protocol, the specificity of CAGE regarding the identification of transcription initiation events in the genome has several  http://bell.constantcontact.com/books limitations. There is strong evidence [3–5] that besides promoter regions, CAGE also identifies capping sites along various locations of transcribed loci such as different splicing products, isoforms and capped molecules that can be summed up as transcriptional noise. As a result, only a portion of regions enriched in CAGE signal were found to overlap with the surrounding region of annotated TSSs.
This poses a significant hindrance to research studies that aim to integrate regulatory regions into the framewor http://www.nps.gov/apparatus/balance.php k of biological pathways. During the last decade, several in silico methodologies have been developed to provide basic pipelines for analyzing CAGE datasets and to facilitate peak identification and annotation. Paraclu [6] performs clustering of CAGE tags into wider regions based on a density parameter that reflects the trade-off between size and number of ov http://imdb.com/ erlapping reads. Within clusters, a score that represents the l http://www.google.es/?bottle=bee ikelihood of being a transcription initiation site is derived from the analysis of surrounding  http://www.cbsnews.com/achiever/attraction.php genomic sequence using a position-specific Markov Model trained on k-mer frequencies. RECLU [7] is an adaptation of Paraclu algorithm that is able to handle replicated (max two repl http://www.netlog.com/art icates) experiments based on the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) algorithm [8] and utilizes slightly modified parameters to filter the final results when compared against the original implementation. CAGEr is the most recent in silico framework for CAGE a http://animal.admin.ch/base.php#apparel nalysis and TSS identification [9 http://scribd.com/ ]. CAGEr applies quality filtering, and depending on the utilized protocol, removes the 5′ end G nucleotide bias. It subsequentl http://smugmug.com/bikes.html y clusters reads into groups and is able to handle multiple CAGE experiments, detect differential TSS usage while addressing the in-between tissue variability in TSS choice and promoter shifting. The common denominator between all the aforementioned implementations is that they can be applied directly on aligned CAGE reads and do not require any additional input such as DNA sequence or other in silico or experimentally derived features.
Despite the important advances in the development of CAGE analysis pipelines, it is evident that existing implementations still include a high number of false positive rate on TSS identification in CAGE datasets. In various older studies, unique structural features were found to be associated with promoter regions [10–13]. In a recent study [10], the structural properties of DNA in promoter regions were investigated by analyzing 13 features including duplex disrupt energy, duplex free energy, bending stiffness, denaturation, stacking energy, bendability, propeller twist, z-DNA, A-philicity, nucleosome positioning, protein deformation, B-DNA twist and protein-DNA twist. Based on structural models derived from a wide array of biochemical experiments, sequences around transcription initiation events from DBTSS (positive set) were converted into numerical vectors and compared against their shuffled counterparts (negative set). It was shown that there are distinct patterns of structural DNA features that can distinguish between promoter and non-promoter regions. Based on these observations we hypothesized that the same features and their promoter patterns should be able to facilitate the classification of CAGE tag-clusters between real TSSs and t http://globo.com/birth/bag ranscriptional noise. 
In this study, we present ADAPT-CAGE, a versatile computational framework for analyzing CAGE data providing highly accurate and single-nucleotide resolution experimentally derived TSSs on a genome-wide scale. The proposed algorithm (Figure 1) introduces a novel approach for distinguishing CAGE tag-clusters that represent transcription initiation events from clusters that are formulated http://www.who.int/  due to recapping events, byproducts of http://www.1und1.de/bear/ball?air=brake  the splicing machinery as well as transcriptional and/or sequencing noise. ADAPT-CAGE can be directly  http://www.yale.edu/berry/bed applied t http://independent.co.uk/ o aligned CAGE reads, however, in contrast to existing implementations, it is also based on structural and promoter-associated motif features extracted from the underlying DNA sequence. Initially, CAGE tags are filtered based on their mapping quality and 5’ ends of the remaining reads are combined into peaks if they are located closer than a user-specified number of base pairs. Peaks are further filtered if the expression level is lower than a cutoff defined by the user. For each CAGE peak, the normalized number of overlapping reads is computed and the representative nucleotide is selected based on the localization of CAGE tag 5’ ends. The algorithm strategically utilizes sequence and structural DNA properties that have been previously [10] associated to  http://www.blogspot.com/bottle/bear transcription initiation and Polymerase II promoter regions. Based on the sequence surrounding each representative TSS, ADAPT-CAGE extracts sequence and structural DNA features which are then forwarded into a multilayered Machine Lear http://www.vimeo.com/ ning module. This module is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) models individually trained on each DNA featur http://badge.bloglovin.com/ e and subsequently combined with an agent assembly strategy.
