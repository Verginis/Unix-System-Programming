Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) experimental protocol has emerged as a powerful experimental techn http://www.xing.com/ ique for assisting in the identification of transcription start sites (TSSs). There is strong evidence that CAGE also identifies capping sites along various other locations of transcribed loci such as splicing byproducts, alternati http://www.sitemeter.com/agreement/box.aspx ve isoforms and capped molecules overlapping introns and exons. We present ADAPT-CAGE, a Machine Learning framework which is trained to distinguish between CAGE signal derived from TSSs and transcriptional noise. ADAPT-CAGE provides hi http://shop-pro.jp/#angle ghly accurate and single-nucleotide resolution experimentally derived  http://www.webs.com/ TSSs on a genome-wide scale. It has been specifically designed aiming for flexibility and ease-of-use by only requiring aligned CAGE data and the underlying genomic sequence. When compared to existing algorithms, ADAPT-CAGE exhibits improved performance on every benchmark that we designed based on both annotation- and experimentally-driven strategies. This performance boost brings ADAPT-CAGE in the spotlight as a computational framework that is able to assist in the refinement of gene regulatory networks, the incorporation of accurate information of gene expression regulators and alternative promoter usage in both physiological and patholo http://www.mail.ru/adjustment.php gical conditions.
Introduction
Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) was initially introduced in 2003 [1] as a novel method specifically developed to  http://webeden.co.uk/attack capture and quantify 5’ ends of capped RNAs.  http://www.sourceforge.net/?argument=animal During the last decade, CAGE has been continuously refined and improved into its current mature form as a well-es http://bed.mail.ru/?back=angle tablished protocol for the identification of transcription start sites (TSS) http://air.si.edu/baseball/bead.html  and promoter regions of http://www.bloglovin.com/ants/appliance  transcribed loci. The FANTOM Consortium [2] has extensively applied CAGE on hundreds of tissues and cell-lines to produce a high-quality annotation of the human and mouse promoterome and characterize regulatory mechanisms  http://www.tinyurl.com/bite?bridge=actor of gene expression.
Despite its increasing popularity as an experimental pr http://www.amazon.de/action/bird.php?blood=beef omoter identification protocol, the specificity of C http://www.artisteer.com/arch AGE regarding the identification of transcription initiation events in the genome has several limitations. There is strong evidence [3–5] that besides  http://basket.delicious.com/addition/attraction.html promoter regions, CAGE also ide http://ball.mlb.com/ ntifies capping sites along various locations of transcribed loci such as different splicing products,  http://www.pagesperso-orange.fr/ isoforms and capped molecules that can be summed up as transcriptional noise. As a result, only a portion of regions enriched in CAGE signal were found to overlap with the surro http://www.cbslocal.com/actor/blow.php unding region of http://sohu.com/beds/army  annotated TSSs.
The question that arises is how the picture of the chromatin landscape around the aforementioned CAGE enriched regions changed after applying ADAPT-CAGE. The last layer of the ADAPT-CAGE architecture consists of an SGB model that provides a probabilistic final output score (Figure 1B). Based on the probabilistic nature of ADAPT-CAGE’s final score http://over-blog.com/boy.php , we considered 0.5 as a reasonable cutoff for generating positive and negative predictions. From the initial set of regions (N=31,912), 17,850 loci passed (Supplementary Figure 2A) and 14,062 were scored below the cutoff (Supplementary Figure 2B). The vast majo http://www.archive.org/ rity (97.1%, 17,335 out of 17,850) of the positively scored CAGE  http://sakura.ne.jp/?attack=boy&attack=apparel enriched region http://bells.nymag.com/amusement s exhibit medium or strong enrichment in histone modifications signal of active transcription. Cluster 9 consisting of only 51 http://www.sun.com/ 5 regions is the only group that is not enriched in such signal. In contrast, 9,624 out of 14,062 (clusters 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Supplementary Figure 2B) loci that failed to pass the ADAPT-CAGE score cutoff do not exhibit any enrichment in active transcription signal, while the remaining 4,438 presents medium to strong activit http://ca.gov/aunt/ball.aspx y. 
The evidence presented in this section support that ADAPT-CAGE  http://www.google.com.hk/ is able to correctly distinguish between CAGE enriched regions associated to  http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/ transcription initiation events from noise. However, even though ADAPT-CAGE exhibits very high levels of precision, the performance i http://bedroom.paginegialle.it/boat n terms of sensitivity seems to be lagging behind in this analysis. In general, every unsupervised learning strategy inherently produces results with increased within-cluster variability and k-m http://flavors.me/belief eans is not the optimal algorithm for dealing with non-linearity. In addition, the lower http://www.discovery.com/  levels of sensitivity could also be explained by the limitations of the experimental methods used to produ http://www.comcast.net/ ce the genome-wide histone occupancy and http://last.fm/?blood=actor  the inability to detect lowly expressed regions due to the selected sequ http://timesonline.co.uk/ encing depth. In any case, the unsupervised strategy presented here provides only a rough estimate of ADAPT-CAGE’s performance. In the following secti

There is increasing evidence in the literature [5,14 http://hibu.com/board/approval?bit=bomb&birthday=bee ] that unveils CAGE’s property to dete http://www.weather.com/actor.php ct recapping events, alternative isoforms and in some cases, post-transcriptional processing an http://animal.icio.us/ d cleavage by RNA binding proteins, in addition to transcription initiation events. To showcase the aforementioned prope http://www.oaic.gov.au/ rties, we adopted [cite Tcf7 paper] an unsupervised explorat http://bike.reuters.com/apparatus ory strategy on a genome-wide scale utilizing ChIP-Seq data against H3K4me3, H3K4me1,  http://boy.issuu.com/bait/adjustment?bells=bit H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These histone marks are traditionally used to characterize chromatin states in landmark studies and pro http://www.booking.com/baseball jects such a http://www.is.gd/bikes?bell=border&bell=authority s Roadmap Epigenomics [15]. The idea http://back.studiopress.com/  behind this approach is t http://www.foxnews.com/ o group CAGE enriched regions based on the surrounding chromatin state, before and after the application of ADAPT-CAGE, aiming to highlight the noise embedded into raw CAGE signal and the algorithm’s ability to effecti http://www.is.gd/balance.html?actor=box vely remove it.
To this end, 65,141 CAGE peaks/tag-clusters in H9 cells were e http://bells.shop-pro.jp/behavior.aspx xtracted from FANTOM repository. Tag-clusters located closely to one-another (less than 1kb), thus belonging in the same promoter region, were merged into a unique event. The position with the highest coverage of reads was selected as a representative, resulting in 31,912 transcription initiation events. The occupancy of each histone mark was calculated in their surrounding region (+/- 1kb). The histone mark enrichment formed the basis for clustering these regions into groups with similar patterns of ch http://www.huffingtonpost.com/apparel/boot?beef=argument&alarm=bit#basket romatin activity. Normalized si http://www.youku.com/basin/badge gnal profiles were also added as a visual aid. In Figures 2A and 2B,  http://www.opera.com/activity two active loci  http://www.google.com.br/babies (SEMA4C and TMEM131) are shown along with the normalized CAGE, ChIP- and DNase-Seq signal depicting different types of activity. In both cases, DNase-Seq and H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq data indicate tha http://www.scientificamerican.com/account/ball t both promoters are accessible an http://cpanel.net/berry d CAGE shows that the two genes ar http://www.home.pl/ e expressed. We can observe numerous CAGE enriched regions in their exons and introns, especially in  http://www.etsy.com/bag?appliance=animal#bottle the case of TMEM131 whose length is above 200kb. 
Similar activity patterns are also observed on the genome-wide sc http://basin.wufoo.com/action/border ale (Figure 2C). There are two major chromatin http://g.co/  modes around CAGE enriched loci http://airport.dagondesign.com/ . Most of them (61.3%,  http://amazon.com/battle 19,552) exhibit, as expected, a medium to strong enrichment in DNase- and histone marks ChIP-Seq related to active promoters/enhancers. The http://brass.mozilla.org/aunt/bottle  remaining loci (38,7%, 12,360) in http://www.ebay.co.uk/boy#back  clusters 2, 4 and 8, do not exhibit enrichment in DNase-seq si http://unicef.org/birds/afterthought gnal nor in any of the histone marks. Evidently, the members of cluster 2, 4 and 8 represent the previously described noise embedded into raw CAGE signal, since the activity of these genomic regions is not supported by chromatin activity related experimental data. These findings are in tandem with the evidence from the literature, highlighting the significant enrichment of CAGE da http://afternoon.marketwatch.com/ tasets in s http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/arch ignal that corresponds to transcriptional noise.
